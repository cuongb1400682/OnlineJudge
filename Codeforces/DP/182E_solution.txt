182E - Wooden Fence

Conditions of the problem was formulated incorrectly, leading to a mismatch decisions correct option conditions will be very soon, the participants bring their apologies.

The basis of the solution of this problem - it is dynamic programming.

Status - (last, type, l), where the last - number of the last board, type characterizes the turn of the last board, and l - length of the remainder of the fence.

Convert this dynamic is also very simple: iterate over the next number of the board, its rotation, check whether it is appropriate in the current state, and add the desired amount.

Asymptotic behavior of solutions - O (n2 Â· len).
